# stig-reporter
The STIG Reporter manages STIG checklist documentation for one or more computing systems. STIG documents can be loaded directly in to the application for searching and browsing of security controls. Review subject areas and checklists can be created from the STIG documents and edited simultaneously by multiple users. Management has access to real-time metrics on STIG compliance, and security officers can generate a variety of export files to report compliance up the chain of command.
